## What is shopping_cart?

It is a eCommerce service that mainly stores shopping cart items for payment processing. See [General Information](general-information/) section for more information what the app does.

## Live Issue Decision Process

Follow this decision flow in order to manage the triggered incident. Acknowledge the alert and then first check the following key support channels to see if an incident is already in progress:

1. [#topic-major-incident-comms](#the-slack-channel)
2. [#topic-ops-bridge](#the-slack-channel)
3. [#team-platform](#the-slack-channel)

**If a major incident hasn't already been triggered, and you think it is required trigger it before doing anything else.**

**Trigger it immediately using the 'run a play' button on the PagerDuty Incident.**
